# COP-3003-Integration-Project
The integration project for my Programming II class that I will be developing is a game that is based on the app called Crossy Road which is similar to the classic Frogger game. The objective of the game is to cross an endless series of roads and avoid obstacles as far as possible without dying. The project will be written in C++ coding language and developed using Microsoft Visual Studio. The skills that I have acquired from the Programming II course will be applied in this project such as designing and implementing a class, using subclassing to design simple class hierarchies, correctly reason about control flow in a program, using object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members, and much more.
