# COP-3003-Integration-Project
The integration project for my Programming II class that I will be developing is a C++ Certification Exam Preparation Program. The objective of the program is to help students exercise their critical thinking and problem solving skills to prepare for the CPA exam. The project will be written in C++ coding language and developed using CLion. The skills that I have acquired from the Programming II course will be applied in this project such as designing and implementing a class, using subclassing to design simple class hierarchies, correctly reason about control flow in a program, using object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members, and much more.
