# COP-3003-Integration-Project
The integration project for my Programming II class that I will be developing is a Certification Exam Preparation Program. The project will be written in C++ coding language and developed using Microsoft Visual Studio. The Certification Exam Preparation Program will consist of multiple choice questions with a point system. The purpose of this program is to help students prepare and exercise their critical thinking skills for the CPA - C++ Exam. The skills that I have acquired from the Programming II course will be applied in this project such as designing and implementing a class, using subclassing to design simple class hierarchies, correctly reason about control flow in a program, using object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members, and much more.
